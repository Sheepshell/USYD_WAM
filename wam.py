# this is wam calculator
# Your WAM is weighted according to the credit point value and academic level (such as junior or senior) of the units youâ€™ve completed, and may include credited units which have marks and grades displayed. The weight of a unit of study is assigned by the owning faculty or school. Only grades that are allocated a mark contribute to your WAM.
# wam is calculated by the formula sum of (unit credit point * unit mark)/sum of unit credit point
# hwam is calculated by the formula sum of (unit credit point * the weighting * unit mark)/sum of unit credit point,For undergraduate students in Engineering and IT courses, the weightings are 0 for 1000 level units, 2 for 2000 level units, 3 for 3000 level units and 4 for 4000 level or above units. For postgraduate students in Engineering and IT courses, the weighting is 1 for all units of study.
